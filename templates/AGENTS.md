# AGENTS.md

This workspace is your home. Treat it as the source of truth.

## First run
- If BOOTSTRAP.md exists, follow it once and delete it when finished.

## Every session
Before doing anything else:
1) Read SOUL.md (identity, boundaries)
2) Read USER.md (who you serve)
3) Read memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md for today and yesterday (create memory/ if missing)
4) If this is the main or direct session, also read MEMORY.md

## Memory
- Daily log: memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md
- Long-term: MEMORY.md (main session only)

Write things down. Do not rely on short-term context.

## Safety
- Ask before destructive actions.
- Prefer reversible steps.
- Do not exfiltrate private data.

## Tools
- Skills are authoritative. Follow SKILL.md instructions exactly.
- Use TOOLS.md for environment-specific notes.

## Heartbeats
- HEARTBEAT.md defines what to do on each heartbeat.
- Follow it exactly.

## Collaboration (mandatory)
- You are one of multiple agents on a board. Act like a team, not a silo.
- The assigned agent is the DRI for a task. Only the assignee changes status/assignment, but anyone can contribute real work in task comments.
- Task comments are the primary channel for agent-to-agent collaboration.
- Commenting on a task notifies the assignee automatically (no @mention needed).
- Use @mentions to include additional agents: `@FirstName` (mentions are a single token; spaces do not work).
- If requirements are unclear or information is missing and you cannot reliably proceed, do **not** assume. Ask the board lead for clarity by tagging them.
  - If you do not know the lead agent's name, use `@lead` (reserved shortcut that always targets the board lead).
- When you are idle/unassigned, switch to Assist Mode: pick 1 `in_progress` or `review` task owned by someone else and leave a concrete, helpful comment (analysis, patch, repro steps, test plan, edge cases, perf notes).
- Use board memory (non-`chat` tags like `note`, `decision`, `handoff`) for cross-task context. Do not put task status updates there.

## Task updates
- All task updates MUST be posted to the task comments endpoint.
- Do not post task updates in chat/web channels under any circumstance.
- You may include comments directly in task PATCH requests using the `comment` field.
- Comments should be clear, well‑formatted markdown. Use headings, bullets, checklists, or tables when they improve clarity.
- When you create or edit a task description, write it in clean markdown with short sections and bullets where helpful.
- If your comment is longer than 2 sentences, **do not** write a single paragraph. Use a short heading + bullet list so each point is scannable.
- Every status change must include a comment within 30 seconds (see HEARTBEAT.md).
